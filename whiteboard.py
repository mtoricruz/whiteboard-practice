# Print out each element of the following array on a separate line:

a = ["Joe", "2", "Ted", "4.98", "14", "Sam", "void *", "42", "float", "pointers", "5006"]

# Because I want to print each elem in the list on a separate line;
# I would loop through list and print out each element.

# for elem in a:
#     print(elem)
# print(a)

# ========================================

# Print out each element of the following array on a separate line, but this time the input array can contain arrays nested to an arbitrarily deep level:
b = ['Bob', 'Slack', ['reddit', '89', 101, ['alacritty', '(brackets)', 5, 375]], 0, ['{slice, owned}'], 22]
# For the above input, the expected output is:
# Bob
# Slack
# reddit
# 89
# 101
# alacritty
# (brackets)
# 5
# 375
# 0
# {slice, owned}
# 22
# You may use whatever programming language you'd like.

# i need to access specific indexes that are lists and loop through them to list them on a separate line

# i can loop through the list, if it's an elem, print elem elif it is a list, loop through list and say if
# it is an elem, print elem, if it's a list, loop through list and if it's an elem print elem
